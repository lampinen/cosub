A command-line tool for creating external HITs on Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

## Philosophy

Many behavioral scientists use a Mechanical Turk workflow where they create a single External HIT with many assignments.
This corresponds to a single experiment with many participants.
The same HIT is often repurposed for multiple versions of the same experiment, so there's a need for a HIT management tool that facilitates multiple rounds of data collection and updating.
